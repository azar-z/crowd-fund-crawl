This research pursues two primary objectives. The first is to design and evaluate an agent-based system for the \textbf{structured information extraction} of crowdfunding projects from \lr{HTML} content. To this end, three distinct strategies are implemented and compared as independent agents (\lr{Basic}, \lr{Function}, and \lr{Expert}) based on human-annotated ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of the \lr{Expert} agent, which achieves \textbf{90.9\%} accuracy by leveraging \lr{HTML} cleaning and intelligent merging. The second objective is to assess the efficacy of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm. For this, an automated judge based on the lightweight \lr{Gemma} model was implemented and its performance was compared against human evaluation. The results show that the automated judge is highly reliable for future research, achieving an \lr{F1-score} above 90\%. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of trade-offs in extraction strategies while also validating the use of an automated judge for such validation tasks.
