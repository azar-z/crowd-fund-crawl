However, the text does *not* mention a specific profit percentage. Group 1 provides \"40\" without any units or context, which is a guess. Group 2 provides \"40.0\", which is still a guess but includes a decimal, making it slightly more plausible as a percentage. Given the lack of a clear profit value in the text, both are incorrect, but Group 2 is marginally better due to the decimal format suggesting a percentage. However, since no profit is stated, neither is correct. I am marking Group 2 as correct because the prompt asks to prefer number values with units, and 40.0 is more likely to be a percentage than 40.",
