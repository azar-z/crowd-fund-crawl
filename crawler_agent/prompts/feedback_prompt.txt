Perform a THOROUGH extraction of {object_description} using `{function_name}`.

This is a previous response that I've got for my question:
{previous_extraction}

- try to fill the fields that are empty or null/none/unknown
- if a str field is just a number in previous_response, try to find the unit too and return the full response with number and unit.
- if any filed is wrong in previous response, correct it

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
✓ All required fields are extracted
✓ Text fields contain complete, untruncated information
✓ Numbers include proper units and formatting
✓ No placeholder or generic values
✓ Information matches what's actually in the HTML

Be extremely careful and methodical. Extract exactly what you see in the HTML.

HTML:
{html_content}
