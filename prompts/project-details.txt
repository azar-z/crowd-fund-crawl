I want to extract these 4 parameters from a webpage:
company
project name
profit
guarantee

here is an example of what this page would contain:

-----

In this example these are the values that I expect:

company = -----
name = -----
profit = -----
guarantee = -----

I want a python method with this format:
def get_project_data(url: str) -> Project


class Project:
    def __init__(self, company, name, profit, guarantee):
        self.company = company
        self.name = name
        self.profit = profit
        self.guarantee = guarantee

Do not explicitly use the parameter values of the example I gave you.
Please use selenium for loading the page and beautifulsoup.
Note that I am using selenium 4.25 so no need to specify driver path.
Also use options.add_argument("--headless") and wait 10 seconds for the page to fully load.

thank you in advance
