context:
I want to extract these 4 parameters from a webpage:
company
project name
profit
guarantee

tools:
- python
- selenium
- beautifulsoup

method signature:
I want a python method with this format:
def get_project_data(url: str) -> Project

where Project is this class that I already have:

class Project:
    def __init__(self, company, name, profit, guarantee):
        self.company = company
        self.name = name
        self.profit = profit
        self.guarantee = guarantee

notes:
- Do not explicitly use the output values of the example I gave you.
- I am using selenium 4.25 so no need to specify driver path.
- Use options.add_argument("--headless") and wait 10 seconds for the page to fully load.

request:
please give me the python method

example:
here is an example of what this page would contain:

-----

expected output:
In this example these are the values that I expect:

company = -----
name = -----
profit = -----
guarantee = -----
