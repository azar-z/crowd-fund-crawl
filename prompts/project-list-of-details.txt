context:
I want to extract a list of projects from a webpage.
Each project has 4 parameters:
company
project name
profit
guarantee

tools:
- python
- selenium
- beautifulsoup

method signature:
I want a python method with this format:
def find_new_projects(self) -> List[Project]

where Project is this class that I already have:

class Project:
    def __init__(self, company, name, profit, guarantee, url):
        self.company = company
        self.name = name
        self.profit = profit
        self.guarantee = guarantee
        self.url = url

notes:
- This page's url is: -----
- Do not explicitly use the output values of the example I give you.
- I am using selenium 4.25 so no need to specify driver path.
- Use options.add_argument("--headless") and wait 10 seconds for the page to fully load.

request:
please give me the python method

example:
here are two projects in this page:

first project:

-----

second project:

-----

expected output:
In this example these are the values that I expect:
the first project:
company = -----
name = -----
profit = -----
guarantee = -----

the second project:
company = -----
name = -----
profit = -----
guarantee = -----
