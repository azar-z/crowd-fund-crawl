I want to crawl a page with a list of items and find the list of urls to those items.

here are two items in this page:

-----

In this example this is the output I expect:

urls = ["-----", "-----", ...]


and you have to click on this html element before crawling:

-----

I want a python method with this format to return the list of urls:
def get_project_urls()

this page's url is: -----


Please use selenium and beautifulsoup.
Note that I am using selenium 4.25 so no need to specify driver path.
Also use options.add_argument("--headless") and wait 10 seconds for the page to fully load.

thank you in advance
